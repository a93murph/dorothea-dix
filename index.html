          <li>Dix was born in Hampden, Maine in 1802.</li>
          <li>
            She set out to tour mental hospitals across the country. She often
            reported her findings to several politicians.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the Civil War started, Dix completely dedicated herself to the
            Union cause. She was designated as the Superintendent of Army Nurses
            for the Union Army.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dix was also known for treating both Confederate and Union soldiers.
          </li>
          <li>
            During a period when male doctors openly expressed disdain for
            female nurses, Dix continued to push for formal training and more
            opportunities for women nurses.
          </li>
          <li>
            After the war, Dix raised funds for the building of a national
            monument to honor deceased soldiers, which stands at Fort Monroe,
            Virginia today.
          </li>
          <li>
            She died on July 17, 1887 and is buried in Cambridge Massachusetts.
